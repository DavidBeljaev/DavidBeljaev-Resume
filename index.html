        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">3rd-year psychology major heading towards a graduate program where I can get a PsyD in clinical psychology to help people all around the world. My goal is to be able to create a building where I can have my own therapeutic building and have multiple psychologists working in the same building, with different varieties of help. While going to University and working being able to gain more experience perspective and knowledge truly helped encourage my goal of accomplishing this journey. Planning steps ahead to accomplish to be able to be a clinical psychologist has been such a journey and worth every moment. One of my plans is to be able to travel around the world and be able to teach and build more practices to be able to help people all around the world. Showing different perspectives and correlations that can be seen through real-world scenarios. With this motivation and passion, I hope I am able to help others and be able to motivate and inspire future generations. <br><br>

        Being able to work at home depot has helped me grasp several perspectives and interactions. With being able to help find and solve problems that customers are having, It helps them learn and grasp perspective on where things are and how it works. But mainly when a customer asks for help. I tend to focus on how perspectives and communication will work in the end, when it's with the best solution or maybe at its worst when there's no stock and or it's online only. Having multiple interactions a day you get to see multiple different personalities with multiple different perspectives, and emotions. By nearly having thousands of interactions a week being able to gain that many perspectives and interactions. Really makes me want to be a clinical psychologist. Seeing the reaction of a person who I was able to help really lightens my day and makes me feel more motivated to help the next person. Even when things don't go as planned, being able to go through that experience helps for the next one coming. <br><br>

        Getting as much knowledge and perspective is the best outcome I try and go by to figure out problems in the most successful way possible. Because even if the situation is similar there is always something different that is going through that scenario. So being able to try and stay the most prepared helps give out the best help and outcomes I can bring. Being a therapist has been a passion of mine ever since I was in middle school I knew that I wanted to be a clinical psychologist and help people out, because everyone goes through something hard in their life and life isn't easy alone. Being able to know that someone can rely on me to help them is something that I think is very important because I am all about trust and respect. Once I am able to open our own therapeutic building, I will expand and open more all around the world, helping people from multiple different countries. Bringing multiple different perspectives.
